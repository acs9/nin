<h2>Scam alert</h2>
<p><strong>Nightingale Institute of Nursing, Noida does not have any branch in India. Candidates should not get confused by anyone/advertisement claiming to represent or take admission.</strong></p>

<p>We are concerned by websites claiming to represent Nightingale Institute of Nursing, Noida (NIN) and misguide students that they are a valid route to admission to this institute.</p>

<p>There is a deliberate attempt to intentionally mislead people to steal money or personal information, or dishonestly achieve monetary gain.</p>

<p>Some of the websites that have come to our notice include</p>
<ul>
<li>http://www.admissionjankari.com/college-details/b.sc-nursing/nightingale-institute-of-nursing-noida</li>
<li>http://www.getmyuni.com/college/nightingale-institute-of-nursing-nin-noida-courses-fees</li>
<li>http://www.indiastudychannel.com/colleges/54417-Nightingale-Institute-Nursing-Noida.aspx</li>
<li>http://collegedunia.com/college/12059-nightingale-institute-of-nursing-nin-noida</li>
</ul>
<p>They use our name to make their story appear legitimate. Some offer false promises of admission to NIN. The content is wrong and the websites even lead students to a payment gateway where they accept online payments. No form is filled in and no admission is done.</p>

<p>We urge students, parents and visitors to be on the lookout for such websites and avoid them; be alert. NIN does not have any affiliations with any education information websites. NIN admissions are in conducted directly with the students and parents and they are required to come in person to the Institute. NIN will never request money over the phone or through a third-party.</p>

<p>We also invite you to notify NIN via social media, email or any means possible. It is our constant endeavour to maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide the best possible nursing education.</p>

<p>Becoming a victim of fraudulent activity could mean you lose your money or your personal identifiable information.</p>
